## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hello there! Thanks for thinking I'm interesting enough to check up on. If you've come this far, I encourage you to say hello before you leave :)

My name is Yixin Zou (pronounced "Yee-Shin Zoh"). I am a tenure-track faculty member at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sp.org/">Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP)</a> in Bochum, Germany. I am also a principal investigator as part of the <a href="https://casa.rub.de/en/">CASA Cluster of Excellence</a> at <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en">Ruhr University Bochum (RUB)</a>. Before joining MPI-SP, I earned my Ph.D. in Information at the University of Michigan. My CV is available <a target="_blank" href="https://yixinzou.github.io/zou-cv.pdf">here</a>.

At MPI-SP, I lead the Human-Centered Security and Privacy group, where we conduct qualitative, quantitative, design, and measurement research aimed at making technologies safer and more equitable for everyone -- especially marginalized and underserved communities. Visit our <a href="https://yixinzou.github.io/group">group page</a> to learn more about our current research directions and my amazing team members.
