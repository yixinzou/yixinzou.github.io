This is a Master's level course that examines the ethical, social, and political implications of artificial intelligence (AI). Drawing on perspectives from the social sciences and humanities rather than purely technical approaches, students explore how AI can perpetuate discrimination, bias, and injustice, the responsibilities of various actors when AI causes harm, the politics of AI datasets, approaches for explaining AI decision-making, auditing, regulation, and more. Through critical analysis and assignments, students learn to assess AI-caused harms, evaluate mitigation strategies, and reflect on how to design and deploy AI systems more equitably and responsibly.

This is a Master's level course that aims to equip students with the knowledge and practical skills to design and implement privacy-preserving systems. Key topics include privacy definitions and concepts, privacy by design, privacy engineering, data governance, usable privacy and UX design, and inclusive privacy. Through lectures, readings, and a semester-long individual project, students learn to conduct privacy threat modeling, apply privacy-by-design techniques, reason about the implementation of data governance principles, and create user-friendly privacy interfaces.
