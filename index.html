<p>Hello there! Thanks for thinking I'm interesting enough to check up on. If you've come this far, I encourage you to say hello before you leave :)<br><br>

My name is Yixin Zou (pronounced "Yee-Shin Zoh"). I am a tenure-track faculty member at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sp.org/">Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy</a> in Bochum, Germany, where I lead the Human-Centered Security and Privacy group. I am also a principal investigator at the <a href="https://casa.rub.de/en/">CASA Excellence Center</a> at <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en">Ruhr University Bochum (RUB)</a>. My CV is available <a target="_blank" href="https://yixinzou.github.io/cv/zou-cv.pdf">here</a>.<br><br>

I study questions at the intersection of human-computer interaction and usable privacy & security. My group's current research centers around empowering end users to have more literacy and agency over their personal data when interacting with socio-technical systems, with a particular focus on marginalized and underserved populations.<br><br>

Before joining MPI-SP, I earned my Ph.D. in Information at the University of Michigan, advised by <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Florian Schaub</a>. My PhD dissertation was recognized by an ACM SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award.<br><br>

If you are interested in joining our group, or if you are seeking any form of advising or collaboration, please read <a href="https://yixinzou.github.io/joinus/">this page</a>  first before reaching out to me.<br><br>

<!-- <img src="/images/speaker.png" width="20"> <b>I will have openings for postdocs, PhD students, and research interns for my group at MPI-SP starting from January 2023. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working with me.
