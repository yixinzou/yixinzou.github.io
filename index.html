<p>Hello there! Thanks for thinking I'm interesting enough to check up on. If you've come this far, I encourage you to say hello before you leave :)<br><br>

My name is Yixin Zou (pronounced "Yee-Shin Zoh"). I am a tenure-track faculty member at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sp.org/">Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy</a> in Bochum, Germany, where I lead the Human-Centered Security and Privacy group. I am also a principal investigator as part of the <a href="https://casa.rub.de/en/">CASA Cluster of Excellence</a> at <a href="https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en">Ruhr University Bochum (RUB)</a>. My CV is available <a target="_blank" href="https://yixinzou.github.io/cv/zou-cv.pdf">here</a>.<br><br>

Want a brief highlight of my work? Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emCIKFIbfso">this podcast</a> I did with Cube 5 titled "On the Way to More Digital Security and Privacy for All" as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yvcE22QJ38">this video</a> I did with CASA that featured my day-to-day life. <br><br>

Before joining MPI-SP, I earned my Ph.D. in Information at the University of Michigan, advised by <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Florian Schaub</a>. My PhD dissertation was recognized by an ACM SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award.<br><br>
