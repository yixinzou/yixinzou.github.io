Since 2023, I lead the Human-Centered Security and Privacy group at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP). Our research seeks to empower end-users with more literacy and agency over their personal data when interacting with socio-technical systems. We are strong believers of interdisciplinary research, and always look for opportunities to engage with communities, companies, policymakers, and non-profit organizations to translate our research into practice. 

A few directions of ongoing research in our group include:

<ul>
    <li><b>Accessibility</b>: e.g., making technology more accessible to underserved populations, such as deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals and older adults</li>
    <li><b>Cross-cultural security and privacy</b>: e.g., examining security and privacy advice and experiences in the majority world</li>
    <li><b>Responsible AI</b>: e.g., developing interventions that help laypeople better understand the risks and harms of artificial intelligence (AI) systems</li>
    <li><b>Trust and safety</b>: e.g., auditing and mitigating emerging threats on social media platforms, such as scams and image-based sexual abuse</li>
</ul>

My group's research has been funded by the Max Planck Society, the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft or DFG), Google, and Meta.

<!-- Elissa: I use computational, economic, and social science methods to understand & model usersâ€™ safety decision-making processes. I specifically investigate inequities that arise in these processes and work directly with marginalized and at-risk communities to design systems that facilitate safety equitably and respectfully.

Robin: I ask how experiences with technology can be made more accessible to digitally constrained communities. Specifically, I design, build, and study systems to better engage older adults and people with vision impairments who face barriers to accessing and engaging with technology. I also study how people in these communities are actively engaging digitally and how researchers and designers can learn from their strengths.

Sauvik: Our work, at the intersection of HCI, AI and cybersecurity, is oriented around answering the question: How can we design systems that empower people with improved agency over their personal data and experiences online? 

Asia: Our research centers around developing, examining and computationally operationalizing principles of responsible computing, data protection & governance, and digital well-being.

Yaxing: I aim to enhance people's privacy literacy and empower them with more control of their privacy in our increasingly complicated socio-technical environment.

Nicki: I work to study, build, and deploy sociotechnical systems that improve the lives of underserved communities in the United States and around the world. To achieve this goal, I utilize an interdisciplinary combination of techniques, including: (1) qualitative research to identify and understand the challenges faced by underserved communities; (2) measurement studies and analyses of existing technologies and usage patterns; (3) designing and building novel socio-technical systems that empower people to overcome challenges they face; (4) evaluating the systems I build through fieldwork and deployments with underserved communities; and (5) engaging with companies, governments, and non-profit organizations to transition the results of my work into practice. I believe that working "backwards"---from concrete, real-world problems to new theories and methodological frameworks---maximizes the potential for near-term societal impact while advancing the foundations of HCI research. -->
